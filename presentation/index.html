						What is Blockchain in real life
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						Hi! <br /><br />
						In this lecture, we will learn what Blockchain is in real life.
						<br /><br />
						We will follow a real life analogy to better understand the
						blockchain, as well as why it is different from a traditional
						database and why it is considered such a unique and powerful
						technology that people in general appreciate it so much.

						<li>Data structure</li>
						<li>Arrangement of data in computer memory</li>

							Real-life examples:
							<ul style="color: rgb(250, 231, 90)">
								<li>PDF Docs</li>
								<li>Excel sheets</li>
								<li>MySQL Table</li>

					<aside class="notes">
						So, what is it: a data structure or a network?<br />
						The answer is: it is a data structure.<br />
						It's actually an arrangement that stores information in some way.
						<br /><br />
						So a data structure is nothing but an arrangement of data right in
						the computers memory, and in real life it can be anything, it can
						just be pdf files, you can also call a data structure: an excel
						sheet, a mysql table or any database.<br /><br />
						So blockchain is also a data structure, but a different type of data
						structure.

						The real life analogy I was talking about is a book. When you read a
						book, it is nothing but a kind of blockchain, so you can compare
						real life blockchain with a book.<br /><br />
						Let me show you an example.<br /><br />
						Imagine you have a book and each page actually links to an existing
						page, so the number on each page is the number that actually links
						to the previous page. This means that we can always organize pages
						very easily, such is the nature of pages right in a book. Usually we
						also store the page number in agreements, we actually put the page
						number in order to determine the sequence.<br /><br />
						It turns out that you simply represent one page as one block. But
						what does such a connection between pages give us?<br /><br />
						It makes it very easy to identify a page and it's very easy to put
						them in a certain order, and it's also very easy to tell if a
						certain page has been removed from the whole sequence. This is
						especially important in agreements, because changing just one page
						of an agreement can completely change its meaning.

					<p style="font-size: 32px">
						Wait! What if the content of the page has been altered?
					</p>
					<ul style="color: rgb(250, 231, 90); font-size: 24px">
						<li>
							In that case, lets produce the page number by crunching the
							content of the previous page.
						</li>
						<li>
							Now it makes sense. If anyone changes the content of the page,
							then the next page number will not match if we try to generate it
							using altered page content.

						But wait, what if the content of the page was changed without
						changing the page number. Then who would be responsible and how
						would you determine that?<br /><br />
						Okay, in that case let's create a page number using the content of
						the page, not just the previous page number, so that each page will
						actually also refer to the content of the previous page.<br /><br />
						Imagine lines on a page. Each line on a page, you can think of it as
						a transaction on the blockchain.<br /><br />
						A page has 25 lines or 30 lines, so the next page number will be
						created based on the content of the previous page. That's exactly
						what happens in blockchain, and that's how they form the chain,
						because the content of the next block actually has the signature of
						the previous block as well.<br /><br />
						Let me give you a simple example.<br /><br />
						Let's say there is page number four and there is page number five.
						Page four will have ten lines, in which case page five will also
						have a summary of the contents of page four.<br /><br />
						Now imagine that there are 100 of these pages that are linked
						together in this way. Is it possible to change the content of page
						number 26 without affecting the entire chain?<br /><br />
						The answer is no, impossible.<br /><br />
						You can't make a change so that it can't be detected on the 100th
						page. Because page 100 contains a summary of page 99, and page 98 is
						also linked to page 97 and so on.<br /><br />
						So if you change the content of page 26 by even one single letter on
						one line, the whole book is invalid, and it's very easy to detect
						that somebody has changed the content. That is the concept of
						blockchain technology.<br /><br />

						More about Blockchain

					<ul style="font-size: 24px">
						<li>
							In real Blockchain case, each block is built on top of the recent
							block and use its previous block's content as a signature.
						</li>
						<li>
							Building a block & adding it in the Blockchain is the task of the
							miner nodes.
						</li>
						<li>
							In public Blockchain it is made computationally difficult to add a
							block to prevent attacks.
						</li>
						<li>
							Miners try to guess a number in such a way that if it gets
							crunched with the most recent block's fingerprint than it will
							create a new fingerprint which will be less that the last/most
							recent block in Blockchain.
						</li>
						<li>
							It takes time & computational power to add a Block in the
							Blockchain. Hence there is some reward (currently 6.25 BTC in case
							of Bitcoin Blockchain).
						</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						But there can be certain disadvantages. As I said before, each block
						is built on top of the previous block, like in a book. In our
						example one page is built on top of another page so it is very easy
						to detect any changes and any suspicious activity.<br /><br />
						In the real case of the blockchain, it uses the content of the
						previous blocks as a signature. You know that there is an algorithm
						in computer science that converts any amount of data of any size
						into a string of fixed length called a hash. So, in the case of
						blockchain, what we call a signature is a hash.<br /><br />
						So, creating a block and adding it to the blockchain is the task of
						secondary nodes, but not any general node can add a block.<br /><br />
						In a public blockchain, it is computationally difficult to add a
						block to prevent hacking. In the bitcoin network, for example, it is
						computationally very expensive and very hard to find a new block.<br /><br />
						You might think: Why would anyone make mining very difficult, what's
						the reason? The reason is simple. What if a hacker changes page
						number 26 to the right and also changes page number 27 28 29 30 and
						so on up to page 100 and says, "Okay, there is a new set of pages,
						please use it as the original"?<br /><br />
						If we make it hard for hackers-then they can't invest and create
						that many blocks very easily because it would cost them a lot, so we
						reduce the chances of fake pages in our book.<br /><br />
						Of course, if you make adding blocks difficult, why would anyone
						invest money in their computer or servers to create new blocks? The
						answer is that a miner will be well rewarded for creating blocks.<br /><br />
						Private blockchain can choose other methods of block creation. For
						example, you can sign a contract with the miners and say that only
						you guys. are allowed to create new blocks and the rest of us are
						not allowed, this is called private blockchain.

						Summary
					</p>
					<ul style="font-size: 24px">
						<li>
							It is a decentralized ledge (data structure) where data is being
							stored in blocks in the form of transactions.
						</li>
						<li>
							Remove the dependency on the trusted third party for recording the
							data in Blocks.
						</li>
						<li>
							In public Blockchain more complex algorithm require to avoid the
							malicious activities.
						</li>
						<li>
							Since each block is built on top of previous Block immutability
							has been achieved.
						</li>
						<li>This all exist in memory of the computers.</li>
						<li>
							Every participant of the Blockchain contains the almost same copy
							of the Blockchain.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						That's the idea.<br /><br />
						So basically it's a decentralized system. This means that this whole
						chain of hundreds of blocks, will actually be available to everyone
						on the network, and every node will contain a copy of this book and
						can very easily check if anything has been changed.<br /><br />
						Public blockchain has more complex algorithms needed to prevent
						malicious actions.<br /><br />
						And because each block is built on top of the previous block,
						immutability has been achieved, which is why some people say that
						the data stored in the blockchain is immutable.<br /><br />
						So that's the idea behind blockchain.<br /><br />
